# 2048 Game

Welcome to the 2048 Game, a simple yet addictive puzzle game where the goal is to combine tiles with the same number to create a tile with the number 2048. This project is built using Python and Pygame.


2048 is a sliding tile puzzle game. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game is won when a tile with a value of 2048 appears on the board, but players can continue to play to achieve higher scores.

This implementation of the 2048 game uses Python and the Pygame library to provide a graphical interface and smooth gameplay experience.

## How to Play

Use the arrow keys to slide the tiles:

Up Arrow: Slide tiles up

Down Arrow: Slide tiles down

Left Arrow: Slide tiles left

Right Arrow: Slide tiles right

When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with the sum of their numbers.

The game ends when there are no possible moves left.
